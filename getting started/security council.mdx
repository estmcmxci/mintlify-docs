<Info> The council was created to address risks from low voter participation relative to the size of the treasury. </Info>

The ENS DAO Security Council is a 4-of-8 Safe multisig with a narrowly defined mandate:
It can only cancel malicious proposals that threaten the DAO, especially those targeting the treasury.

## Purpose and Powers

The Security Council acts only in emergencies, such as:

- If a proposal violates the [ENS Constitution](https://docs.ens.domains/dao/constitution)
- If a proposal is malicious and threatens the DAO’s longevity or sustainability
- If voters are financially incentivized to act against the DAO’s interests
- If a proposal benefits an attacker at the DAO’s expense


The council cannot propose, amend, or initiate governance actions.

## Time-Limited Authority

Two years after deployment, anyone can call `renounceTimelockRoleByExpiration()` to permanently revoke the council’s cancel power, ensuring decentralization over time.
