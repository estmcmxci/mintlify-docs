## Governance

- **Delegation:** $ENS holders can delegate their tokens to others (Delegates), who can then submit and vote on proposals related to ENS protocol changes and DAO treasury spending.
- **Voting:** Each $ENS token represents one vote in the DAO.

## Initial Distribution

- **25% (25 million $ENS):** Allocated to core contributors, ecosystem partners, and community members. Tokens for core contributors and launch advisors are subject to a four-year lock-up and vesting schedule.
- **25% (25 million $ENS):** Available to be claimed as an airdrop by addresses that had registered a .eth second-level domain before the snapshot taken at midnight UTC on October 31, 2021.
- **50% (50 million $ENS):** Allocated to the DAOâ€™s treasury. 10% of this was available at launch, with the remaining remainder unlocking linearly over four years from November 8, 2021.

## Airdrop

- **Eligibility:** Based on .eth registration history and whether the address set a Primary ENS Name.
- **Airdrop Window:** Opened on November 8, 2021, and closed on May 4, 2022.
- **Unclaimed Tokens:** After the airdrop window closed, unclaimed $ENS tokens were transferred back to the DAO treasury.

## DAO Treasury

- **Initial Claim:** 5 million $ENS (10% of the treasury allocation) was claimed at launch.
- **Unclaimed Airdrop Sweep:** On May 5, 2022, unclaimed airdrop tokens were swept back to the DAO treasury.
- **Unlocking:** The remaining 45 million $ENS allocated to the DAO unlocks linearly over four years and can be claimed by the DAO through governance proposals.

## Minting Rights

The ENS DAO has the right to mint up to 2% of the current total supply of $ENS per year. After minting, the DAO must wait one year before it can mint again.
