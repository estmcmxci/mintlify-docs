### Executable Proposals

Executable proposals cover onchain actions such as treasury transfers and contract upgrades. They require at least 100,000 ENS delegated to the proposer. Voting occurs onchain via Tally/Agora for 7 days and requires gas; votes are final once cast. 

A quorum of 1% of all $ENS and a simple majority (50%+) are required. If approved, execution is delayed by a 2‑day timelock.

### Social Proposals

Social proposals cover offchain or advisory actions and require at least 10,000 ENS delegated to the proposer. Voting is held on Snapshot for 5 days and is gasless; voters may change their vote until the deadline. 

Passage requires a 1% quorum of all $ENS and a simple majority (50%+).

### Constitutional Amendments

Constitutional amendments propose changes to the DAO constitution. Voting takes place on Snapshot, is gasless, and lasts 5 days. These proposals require a 1% quorum of all $ENS and must achieve a two‑thirds approval threshold.
