<Info>Voting power in ENS DAO comes from delegated ENS.</Info>

ENS DAO uses token-weighted voting: each $ENS token represents one vote, but only if it is delegated to a voting address (which can be your own or someone else's). Delegation does not lock your tokens; it simply assigns your voting power.

Delegation is required to vote or propose. You can delegate your tokens at any time, but they must be delegated before a vote begins to participate in that vote.
