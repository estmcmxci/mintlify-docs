<Info> "Working Groups" are a key part of ENS DAO's governance structure. </Info>

ENS DAO uses **Working Groups** to manage its work-related activities and fund initiatives in accordance with the [ENS DAO Constitution](https://docs.ens.domains/dao/wg/rules). Working groups allow decisions and funding to be handled efficiently, without requiring every action to go through a full DAO vote.

### Current Working Groups

There are currently three working groups:

- **Meta-Governance**: Oversees DAO governance and administration.
- **Ecosystem**: Focuses on technical development and ecosystem growth.
- **Public Goods**: Supports public goods within ENS and the broader web3 ecosystem.

## Working Group Rules
Working groups are governed by a set of [rules](https://docs.ens.domains/dao/wg/rules), which cover their creation, management, and dissolution. The rules were first established in December 2021 and have since been updated, including extending steward terms to one year.


## Stewards and Elections

Each working group is managed by three elected stewards serving a one-year term. <Tooltip tip="Stewards are elected community representatives who lead ENS DAO working groups, coordinate initiatives, and steward resources on behalf of token holders." cta="Learn more about stewards" href="https://docs.ens.domains/dao/stewards">Stewards</Tooltip> are elected for a one-year term. Elections are held every December and last 5 days. 

Each working group elects three stewards. Elections are administered by the Meta-Governance Working Group, and information is posted in the governance forum with a call for nominees before voting begins.

Within five days of the term starting, each group appoints a Lead Steward.
Stewards also appoint a Secretary for the term, who is a multisig signer and has defined responsibilities.

### Funding
Working group funding requests must be approved as a social proposal during a funding window.
After budget approval, a collective executable proposal is put to a DAO vote. If passed, funds are distributed to the working group’s multisig wallet.

### Multisig Structure

Each working group’s multisig is managed by its three stewards and the secretary (3-of-4 required to sign).
Stewards can form subgroups to delegate funding and responsibilities.
