The Meta-Governance Working Group is responsible for:

- Providing governance oversight for the ENS DAO
- Supporting the management and operation of all working groups
- Overseeing DAO tooling and governance process improvements
- Managing the DAOâ€™s treasury, including funding requests, contract audits, and discretionary spending for new initiatives

## Stewards and Secretary

The group is managed by three elected stewards and a secretary (appointed by the stewards each term).
The current stewards can be found [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/g/Meta-Gov_Stewards).

## Meetings
- Weekly Meta-Gov WG meetings are open to everyone.
- Agendas and meeting notes are posted in the [Governance Forum](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/governance/).
- To add an agenda item, contact the Lead Steward.


## Funding and Multisig

- Funding is requested at the start of each term, following [Rule 10 of the Working Group Rules](https://docs.ens.domains/dao/wg/rules).
- Funding requests are first passed as a Social Proposal, then as part of a Collective Executable Proposal.
- Approved funds are paid from the DAO treasury to the Meta-Gov WG multisig.
- The multisig has four signers: the three stewards and the secretary. Three of four signatures are required for transactions.

## Use of Funds
- Stewards allocate funds to specific initiatives, including governance, contract audits, DAO tooling, and discretionary projects.
- Stewards may reallocate funds as needed, provided it does not conflict with DAO rules or the Constitution ([Rule 10.5](https://docs.ens.domains/dao/wg/rules)).

## Seeking Funding
If you are seeking funding from the Meta-Governance WG, attend a weekly meeting or contact a steward.
