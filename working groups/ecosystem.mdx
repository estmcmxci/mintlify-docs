The Ecosystem Working Group is responsible for: 

- Supporting ENS-specific projects and builders
- Funding hackathons and grants
- Organizing IRL (in-real-life) events
- Technical improvements that directly benefit ENS
- Strategic initiatives that advance the ENS ecosystem 


## Stewards and Secretary

The group is managed by three elected stewards and a secretary (appointed by the stewards each term).
The current stewards can be found [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/g/Ecosystem_Stewards).

## Meetings
- Weekly Ecosystem meetings are open to everyone.
- Agendas and meeting notes are posted in the [Governance Forum](https://discuss.ens.domains/c/governance/).
- To add an agenda item, contact the Lead Steward.


## Funding and Multisig

- Funding is requested at the start of each term, following [Rule 10 of the Working Group Rules](https://docs.ens.domains/dao/wg/rules).
- Funding requests are first passed as a Social Proposal, then as part of a Collective Executable Proposal.
- Approved funds are paid from the DAO treasury to the ENS Ecosystem WG multisig.
- The multisig has **four signers**: the three stewards and the secretary. **Three of four** signatures are required for transactions.

## Use of Funds
- Stewards allocate funds to specific initiatives, including hackathons, grants, builder support, IRL events, and technical improvements.
Stewards may reallocate funds as needed, provided it does not conflict with DAO rules or the Constitution ([Rule 10.5](https://docs.ens.domains/dao/wg/rules)).


## Seeking Funding
If you are seeking funding from the ENS Ecosystem WG, attend a weekly meeting or contact a steward.
